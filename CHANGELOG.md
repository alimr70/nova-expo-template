# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- Internet Detection using NetInfo

## [4.0.1] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Added `lodash` utilities file with custom standard helper implementations (`debounce`, `throttle`, `cloneDeep`, `isEqual`, `uniqBy`, `groupBy`, `orderBy`).
- Added `findChangedFields` utility function to compare two objects and extract modified fields.

### Changed

- Updated plop screen generator template to use `MainScreenWrapper` for main screens and `AuthScreenWrapper` for auth screens.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- **Upgrade to Expo SDK 57** (React Native 0.86.0, React 19.2.3).
- Updated all `expo-*` packages to SDK 57 unified versioning (e.g. `expo-router@~57.0.2`).
- Bumped compatible third-party native deps: `react-native-reanimated@4.5.0`, `react-native-worklets@0.10.0`, and `react-native-gesture-handler@~2.32.0`.
- Removed the outdated `module`/`moduleResolution` (`node16`) and `jsx` overrides from `tsconfig.json` so it inherits Expo's `bundler` resolution — fixes ESM/CJS type errors on `react-native-reanimated`/`react-native-worklets` imports.
- Pinned `@react-native/jest-preset` to `0.86.0` via `overrides` so a plain `npm install` resolves cleanly (works around `jest-expo@57`'s lagging `^0.85.0` peer range) — no `legacy-peer-deps` needed.


## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **AI agent tooling** shared across Claude, Cursor, Codex, and other agents (`.claude`, `.cursor`, `.codex`, `.agents`, `.agent`):
  - Skills for building native UI, Expo API routes, deployment, dev client, native data fetching, upgrading Expo, feature integration, and a skill-creator.
  - Coding rules (atomic-design pattern, icon usage, React Native best practices, styles file structure, translation/i18n, and more).
- **Slash commands** for translation (`translate`, `sync-translations`), SVG generation (`generate-svg`), and console-log cleanup (`remove-logs`).
- **Plop `integration` generator** to scaffold RTK Query API services (`apis/services/<feature>/{index.ts,types.ts}`) and auto-register their cache tags.
- **`Spacing` constants** (`x1`–`x14`, moderate-scaled) for consistent layout spacing.

### Changed

- **Major upgrade to Expo SDK 56** (React Native 0.85.3, React 19.2.3).
- Updated all `expo-*` packages to SDK 56 unified versioning (e.g. `expo-router@~56.2.11`).
- Bumped all third-party dependencies to versions compatible with SDK 56.
- Upgraded TypeScript to 6.0.
- Updated the optional Sentry integration to `@sentry/react-native@^8` (removed deprecated `sentry-expo` / webpack plugin; switched to the `@sentry/react-native/expo` config plugin and v8 tracing API).
- Switched the template `android`/`ios` scripts to `expo run:android` / `expo run:ios` for dev-client builds.
- Restructured the `apis` folder to co-locate each service with its types (`apis/services/<feature>/{index.ts,types.ts}`).
- Improved the `generate-svg` script with dynamic color support, path property injection, and more robust icon-registry updates.

### Fixed

- Corrected a wrong import in the common `dropdown` organism.
- Fixed the `Image` component loading state so the loader shows until the image actually loads (initial `isLoading = true`, using `onLoad` instead of `onLoadStart`/`onLoadEnd`).

### Removed

- Dropped the unmaintained `react-native-status-bar-height` dependency in favor of `Constants.statusBarHeight` from `expo-constants`.
